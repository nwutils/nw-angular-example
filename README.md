# NW.js and Angular CLI example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8. Though dependencies have been updated since then. You'll likely want to clone from `main` rather than use the latest release. Here is the [diff between the latest release and main](https://github.com/nwutils/nw-angular-cli-example/compare/v1.3.0...main).

## Running Locally for development

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Webpack will spin up (takes a moment) then a window will pop up

You can also run this repo in a regular browser with `npm run start:web`, but will need to add conditionals into your code to skip desktop-specific code (`if (window.nw) {}`).


## Building for distribution

1. `npm run build:clean` will delete your `./dist` and `/dist-ng` folders
1. `npm run build:ng` will build just your Angular app for distribution (`./dist-ng`)
1. `npm run build:nw` will build just your NW.js app (`./dist`)
1. `npm run build` is your all-in-one command. It will clean out the old dist folders and build your Angular and NW.js app


# **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BUILDS!!!**

They take a long time. If you do `npm run build` expect it to take 10-15 minutes. This can be adjusted by changing the build params in the `package.json`. The more platforms and build types, the longer it takes. You can also remove the `--concurrent` from the `build:nw` script to see a status of what has been completed. This will allow individual pieces to finish faster, but the entire build will take longer.
